        Support of the people was crucial, a task at which Shivaji Maharaj
        excelled. He commanded some of the finest soldiers, renowned for their
        exceptional qualities:
        <br>
        <b><u>Courageous and Loyal:</u></b> Shivaji Maharaj's soldiers were distinguished by
        their unwavering courage and steadfast loyalty to their king.
        <br>
        <b><u>Defenders of Dharma:</u></b> Beyond mere warriors, they upheld righteousness
        (dharma), defending their land and people with valor and honor.
        <br>
        <b><u>Resourceful and Agile: </u></b>Known for their resourcefulness and agility in
        battle, Shivaji's soldiers adapted swiftly to changing tactics and
        terrain.
        <br>
        <b><u>Diverse and United:</u></b> Coming from diverse backgrounds, Shivaji's soldiers
        were unified by a shared mission: safeguarding their homeland from
        invaders.
        <br>
        <b><u>Admired and Respected:</u></b> Revered by both allies and adversaries, Shivaji's
        soldiers earned admiration for their discipline, strategic prowess, and
        unwavering commitment.
        <br>
        These qualities defined the soldiers who fought under the banner of
        Shivaji Maharaj, leaving behind a legacy of bravery and resilience in
        Indian history. Many names among them are remembered for their supreme
        sacrifice for Swarajya.
